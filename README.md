RomanNumeralsKata
=================

Roman Numerals Kata done using TDD. Practiced the same day on a Code Dojo in JavaScript and partially inspired by
[Roman Numerals Kata with Commentary](http://blog.coreyhaines.com/2012/12/roman-numerals-kata-with-commentary.html)
by Corey Haines which we have watched at the end of the Dojo.

The only interesting file is `RomanNumeralsKataTests/RomanNumeralsKataTests.m`.

I have practiced this kata once more (result is in `RomanNumeralsKataTests/RomanNumeralsKataTests2.m`) and this time did commit after each successful test implementation, so in addition to the final result the progress can be replayed.
