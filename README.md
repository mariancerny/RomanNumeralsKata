RomanNumeralsKata
=================

Roman Numerals Kata done using TDD. Practiced the same day on a Code Dojo in JavaScript and partially inspired by
[Roman Numerals Kata with Commentary](http://blog.coreyhaines.com/2012/12/roman-numerals-kata-with-commentary.html)
by Corey Haines which we have watched at the and of the Dojo.

The only interesting file is `RomanNumeralsKataTests/RomanNumeralsKataTests.m`.
